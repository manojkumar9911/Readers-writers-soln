let take two Bonary semaphore: 
mutex-binary semaphore, initialized to 1.
write-binary semaphore, initialized to 1.
and an variable readcount, initialized to 0.


WRITERS CODE

readers{
while(true){
wait(mutex);
it will decrease the value of mutex semaphore
readcount++;
readcount value will be increased by 1.
if(readcount==1){
for starvation free if one reader is inside,
then it block writers to enter into the critical section
wait(write);
}
signal(mutex);

CS

wait(mutex);
mutex value will be decrease by 1.
readcount--;
if one reader finish his work then readcount value will be decrease by 1.
if(readcount==0)
if there is no reader then we have to increment the value of 
both semaphores, so that any one can come inside.
mutex also declare that my work is done.
signal(write);
signal(mutex);
}
}
