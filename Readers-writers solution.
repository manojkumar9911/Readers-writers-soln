let take two Bonary semaphore: 
mutex-binary semaphore, initialized to 1.
write-binary semaphore, initialized to 1.
and an variable readcount, initialized to 0.


WRITERS CODE

void  writers{
while(true){
wait(write);

CS

signal(write);
}
}


READERS CODE

void readers{
while(true){
wait(mutex);
readcount++;
if(readcount==1)
wait(write);
}
signal(mutex);

CS

wait(mutex);
readcount--;
if(readcount==0)
signal(write);
signal(mutex);
}
}
